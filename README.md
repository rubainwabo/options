# options

Important : Using a java IDE (eclipse, netbeans, ...) for running the three files together is recommended

1 - Options.java

Read an option as argument which is formatted like "-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" and display the following result :
00000011111111111111111111111111. So an option like "-abc" will give : 00000000000000000000000000000111.

2 - Print_bits.java

Print the binary representation of a number (on 32 bits)

3 - Reverse_bits.java

Reverse bit by bit, all the bits of a number (the first bit becomes the last and so on, ...,  the last becomes the first)
